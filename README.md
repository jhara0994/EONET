# EONET

Project Description - We plan to create a web application that will show natural event risk factors and hold the searches in localStorage to be pulled upon request and help the user determine the natural event risk factors of their desired area. (Bonus if we can break down the events individually on the results page).
 
User story - As a user, I want a web application that will show a list of natural events that have occurred for a specific area within the last 365 days to determine which places are at high-risk in the next 365 days.
